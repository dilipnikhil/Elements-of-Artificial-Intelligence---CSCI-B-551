This repository consists of the approaches and techniques that we used to solve assignments of	Elements of Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-B 551) at IU, Bloomington.
The topics include - Case-based reasoning, knowledge representation, A* and heuristics, Graph Traversals, Probabilistic Reasoning, Monte Carlo Simulations, Markov Chains, and Statistical Learning.

I have provided details ReadMe file under each assignment. Please feel free to peruse them and drop me an email if you'd like to improve our existing techniques.
